# MK-Styles
SDXL styles for Foocus, ComfyUI, Automatic1111 (WebUI), etc.
Sharing some of my styles for Foocus.
Don't hesitate to comment, it's a work in progress.
Have fun.
Just put the JSON in the folder and restart Foocus. 
\Fooocus_####\Fooocus\sdxl_styles

Last update (the styles -included in Foocus) have some issues with negative prompt, I try to correct them). Replace the initial file (sdxl_styles_marc_k3nt3l.json) by the new one.

<h6>Showcase, some samples from my styles</h6>
